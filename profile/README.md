# **SigmaEpsilon** - A Python ecosystem of libraries for computational engineering

SigmaEpsilon is a collection of interrelated libraries to create an ecosystem of tools that make computational engineering more accessible and to provide the necessary technical background for meaningful research in the topic.

## Modules

The namespace consists of the following packages:

- [**sigmaepsilon.core**](https://github.com/sigma-epsilon/sigmaepsilon.core) - Common developer utilities.
- **sigmaepsilon.math** [in progress] - Mathematical solutions to all kinds of problems, mainly centered around linear algebra and optimization.
- **sigmaepsilon.mesh** [in progress]- A module to handle polygonal meshes.
- **sigmaepsilon.solid** [in progress]- For numerical simulations in the field of computational solid mechanics.

Each of these packages comes with their own documentation, where you can find all information on installation, usage, etc.

## Background

The project started off as a need for organizing my code during my PhD studies, and later I (the author) decided to develop it into a system of namespace packages, to accelerate research in the field of Topology Optimization. Hence, the solutions within the modules of the SigmaEpsilon namespace are mainly centered around solid mechanics and optimization.
